    <h1>What Is the Difference Between CCTV Cable and Normal Cable?</h1>

    <p>
        When installing a CCTV system, most people focus on cameras and recorders but ignore one crucial component — the cable.
        Choosing the wrong cable can lead to poor video quality, signal loss, and frequent system failures.
        This article explains the key differences between <strong>CCTV cables and normal electrical cables</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is a CCTV Cable?</h2>
    <p>
        A CCTV cable is specially designed for transmitting video signals, power, and sometimes audio between CCTV cameras and recording devices.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Designed for continuous video transmission</li>
        <li>Low signal loss over long distances</li>
        <li>Strong shielding against interference</li>
        <li>Suitable for indoor and outdoor use</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Is a Normal Cable?</h2>
    <p>
        Normal cables are general-purpose electrical wires used mainly for power supply, lighting, and household appliances.
        They are not designed to carry video signals.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>No video signal support</li>
        <li>Higher interference</li>
        <li>Poor durability for CCTV use</li>
    </ul>
