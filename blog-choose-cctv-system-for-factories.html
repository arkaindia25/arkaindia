    <h1>How to Choose the Right CCTV System for Factories & Warehouses</h1>

    <p>
        Factories and warehouses require a higher level of security compared to homes or small offices.
        Large areas, valuable assets, and continuous operations make it essential to install the right CCTV system.
        Choosing the wrong setup can result in blind spots and security risks.
    </p>

    <h2>Understand Your Security Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        Start by identifying critical areas such as entry and exit points, storage zones,
        production floors, loading bays, and perimeter boundaries.
        This assessment helps determine camera placement and quantity.
    </p>

    <h2>Choose the Right Type of CCTV Camera</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bullet Cameras</strong> – Best for long-distance outdoor monitoring</li>
        <li><strong>Dome Cameras</strong> – Ideal for indoor surveillance</li>
        <li><strong>PTZ Cameras</strong> – Cover large areas with zoom and rotation</li>
        <li><strong>Night Vision Cameras</strong> – Essential for 24×7 security</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Select High-Quality CCTV Cables</h2>
    <p>
        The quality of CCTV cables directly affects video clarity and system reliability.
        Industrial environments require durable, low-loss cables for stable transmission.
        Arka India manufactures high-quality CCTV and security cables suitable for factory and warehouse use.
    </p>

    <h2>Storage and Recording Capacity</h2>
    <p>
        Warehouses generate large volumes of video data.
        Choose storage solutions based on the number of cameras, recording duration,
        and future expansion requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Outdoor & Environmental Protection</h2>
    <p>
        Ensure cameras and cables are resistant to dust, moisture, heat, and vibration.
        Weatherproof equipment increases system life and performance.
    </p>

    <h2>Monitoring and Compliance</h2>
    <p>
        Modern CCTV systems should allow remote monitoring, mobile access,
        and compliance with safety and security regulations.
        These features provide real-time visibility and operational control.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Selecting the right CCTV system for factories and warehouses involves proper planning,
        quality components, and reliable manufacturing.
        A well-designed system improves safety, prevents losses, and supports smooth operations.
